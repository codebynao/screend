Not only that, but a long-promised clean air strategy for the state of New South Wales is already three years overdue. Deforestation, pollution and species extinction are some of the most pressing issues of our time, and many of the world's best storytellers are bringing these issues to life on film. That's a great thing: a well-crafted movie can actually bring us closer to nature and inspire us to protect it. Unfortunately, despite boasting some slick-looking effects, nifty set design and scarily relevant themes, the lumpy screenplay of '2067' makes it hard to recommend.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-2067-muddled-sci-fi-with-an-ecological-conscience",
